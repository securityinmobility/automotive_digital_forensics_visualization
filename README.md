# Project description

This project has been developed in the context of my bachelor thesis. The goal is to find a fitting form of visualization for contextual information in the field of automotive digital forensics. The application should explore forms of data visualization that guide the user's attention to important elements on the current page. Through directing the focus, the user is leaded from element to element and in the end discovers the information they were searching for.
The focus solely lies on the visualization and no other functionality is planned up to now.
